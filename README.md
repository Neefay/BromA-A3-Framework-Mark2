The **BromA Framework** is a community effort made by the BromA group in order to establish a standard shared across all missions - which could then be customized by the content maker.

Since this could only be made thanks to shared scripts, missions and all sorts of knowledge, this project is entirely open-source and interested users are free to play with it as much as they want.

Also keeping up with good practices, most functionality is modular and therefore optional to the user: adding and disabling plugins from the mission is extremely easy.

### FEATURES
*	AGM, TFAR and DAC are fully integrated.
*	Cargo made simple.
*	Casualty Cap and Body Removal, taken from the F3 Framework with given credits.
*	Casualty Cap for civilians.
*	Commander Lock.
*	JIPs can teleport to their squadmates when joining.
*	Limit player movement to the AO.
*	Loading screen to avoid desync at mission start.
*	Mission time limit.
*	Plugin system makes sharing functionality super easy.
*	Respawn system with tickets and respawn waves.
*	Setup Zone for TvTs.
*	Spawn protection.
*	Tasks system which is very flexible and simple to understand.
*	Team Roster.
*	Team killing warning.
*	Teleporting for the mission maker.
*	Very effective loadout system.
*	Well organized and context-agnostic.

The framework is as context agnostic as possible, meaning you can just change one value and your mission will change from a COOP into a TVT or even a COTVT - everything is already pre-configured to be flexible and as little as possible assumptions are made about the mission itself.

### TO DO (priority order):
-
*	- [X] Start working on the documentation.
*	- [ ] Comment and document everything.
*	- [ ] Make loadouts for several mission themes.
	- [X] USM (Marines)
	- [X] Takistani Militia (Taliban/Middle East Militia)
	- [X] PMC (Generic PMC)
	- [X] Chedaki (Eastern Militia)
	- [X] Norwegian Special Forces
	- [X] Molatian Rebels (African Militia)
	- [ ] UN Troops
	- [ ] Takistani Army (Middle East 90s Army)

### What then?

I am very commited to document and explain the usability process of this framework so that even the most clueless user can pick it up and get cracking in a few hours at most - expect a wiki with all the API and functions, and definitely video tutorials since I'm a video learner myself.
